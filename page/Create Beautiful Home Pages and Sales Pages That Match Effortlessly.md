## My Approach to Sharing Lead Magnets

Once you've created your lead magnet or event registration page, you’ll want to share it far and wide. Here are **three effective ways** I use Leadpages to generate leads:

1. **Podcast Call-to-Actions**: Share an easy-to-remember URL while speaking on podcasts or virtual events.
2. **Email Campaigns**: Include event registration pages or free resources in eblasts and newsletters.
3. **Social Media Posts**: Promote opt-ins in relevant groups or communities where promotional content is allowed.

These strategies ensure your audience can easily find and access your content, leading to higher conversions.
