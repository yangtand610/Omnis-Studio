# What is a Landing Page? Why Your Business Needs One

## Introduction

As a seasoned digital marketer, I’ve seen firsthand how critical content can be for entrepreneurs, startups, and small businesses. While all website pages are valuable, **not all website pages serve the same purpose**. 

Among these, landing pages stand out as a pivotal tool for conversions. Unlike other pages, a **landing page** has one job: to convert visitors into leads or customers. 

Did you know the **average landing page conversion rate is 9.7%**? This is significantly higher than other pages on your site, making it a worthwhile investment of your time and effort.

In this article, we’ll explore what a landing page is, its purpose, and how it can drive your business growth by capturing your ideal audience. We’ll also highlight some great examples of landing pages and share tips on creating one that performs effectively.

## What is a Landing Page?

A **landing page** is a dedicated page on your website or blog designed to convert traffic. Visitors typically arrive at this page via:
- Paid or organic search results on Google
- Campaign content, such as social media posts or email sequences

Unlike other pages, landing pages often do not appear in your site’s navigation bar. They are accessed through a direct link, focusing entirely on driving one specific action.

### The One Job of a Landing Page

A landing page has a singular goal: **to convert visitors into leads or customers.**

This means:
- The copy and design focus on one message and one action.
- The page avoids distractions, multiple messages, or conflicting calls to action (CTAs).

#### Why Focus on One CTA?
Your landing page should drive visitors to complete **one action**. This could be:
- Starting a free trial
- Downloading an eBook
- Signing up for a newsletter
- Purchasing a subscription

By narrowing the focus, you eliminate distractions and maximize the chance of conversion.
